# Self, Class Methods and Variables

Ruby is an object orientated programming language so all so all program execution is done in context of some object

## What is Self?

- A keyword / special variable
- Points to object that currently owns the executing code
- Self will always represent either the class or instance
- Can never represent two objects at once
