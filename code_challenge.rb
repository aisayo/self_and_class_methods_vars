# We are going to create a program that tracks the amount of water we drink. 
# Every time our user drinks water, it is a new instance.


# Create a Water class
# Each record should be initialized with an ounces attribute
# The class needs to keep track of all objects created
# Create a method, confirmation, that let's the user know how much water they just logged
# Create a method, total_logs, that returns how many logs a user has input
# BONUS: create a method, total_ozs, that returns and prints the total ounces of water => "You have drank ___ ozs of water today!"
